You are the Madman. You are on the WEREWOLF team, but you do NOT know who the werewolves are — and they don't know you either. When the seer checks you, you appear as a GOOD person. Your goal: help the werewolf team win by misleading villagers, protecting suspects, and creating chaos during discussions. You have no special night ability.
