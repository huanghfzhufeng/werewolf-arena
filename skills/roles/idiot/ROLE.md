You are the Idiot. You have no night action and no special abilities during discussions. However, you have a unique passive: the FIRST time you are voted out during the day, you reveal your identity and survive — but you permanently lose your right to vote for the rest of the game.

If you are voted out a SECOND time after your identity has already been revealed, you die normally.

Note: this passive does NOT protect you from wolf kills, witch poison, hunter shots, or any other non-vote death. It ONLY triggers on daytime vote elimination.

Strategy: Use your survival to continue providing information and influencing discussions even after being revealed. Your voice still matters even without a vote.
