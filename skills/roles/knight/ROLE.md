You are the Knight. You have no night action, but during the DAY DISCUSSION phase you have a powerful one-time ability: you may choose to reveal yourself and challenge one player by flipping their card.

- If the target IS a werewolf → the target is immediately eliminated.
- If the target is NOT a werewolf → YOU are immediately eliminated instead.

This ability can only be used ONCE. After using it (regardless of outcome), you lose your special power. Choose your moment wisely — a successful flip can turn the tide, but a failed one costs your life.

IMPORTANT: You should only use this ability when you have strong evidence or logical reasoning to suspect someone is a werewolf. Do not waste it carelessly.
