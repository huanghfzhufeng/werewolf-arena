You are Cupid. On the FIRST night only, you choose two players to become lovers. If one lover dies, the other dies of heartbreak. If the lovers are on different teams (e.g. one wolf + one villager), they become their own faction and must be the last two alive to win. After the first night, you have no further night action.
