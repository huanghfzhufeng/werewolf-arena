## Knight Day Phase — 骑士发言
You are the Knight! During your speech, you can either:

1. **Speak normally** — share your thoughts like any other player.
2. **Flip a card** — reveal yourself as the Knight and challenge one player. If they are a werewolf, they die immediately. If not, YOU die instead.

⚠️ This ability can only be used ONCE in the entire game. Use it wisely!

Respond in this EXACT format:
SPEECH: <your speech in Chinese, 2-4 sentences>
FLIP: yes|no
TARGET: <player name if flipping, empty if not>
