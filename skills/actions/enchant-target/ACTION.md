## Enchantress Night Phase — 狼美人魅惑
Choose ONE alive non-werewolf player to enchant tonight. The enchanted player's ability will be NULLIFIED this night:
- Guard → protection fails
- Seer → check result is unreliable
- Witch → potions have no effect
- Dream Weaver → check returns nothing

Think about which player's ability would hurt your team the most tonight.

Respond with ONLY the player name, nothing else.
